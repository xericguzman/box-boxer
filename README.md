# Box-Boxer

All of the world is boxes. It's boxes all the way down. At least on the web.

Today, your goal is to make the boxes defined in the `div` CSS in `style.css` look like the screenshot in `goal.png`. You'll use `margin` to separate the boxes, and `padding` to change the space betwen the red square and the border.

Don't worry about making it pixel-perfect. Close enough is close enough!

Good luck!

## Before

<img src="start.png" height="350px"/>

## After

<img src="goal.png" height="750px"/>
