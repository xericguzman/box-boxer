# Box-Boxer

All of the world is boxes. It's boxes all the way down. At least on the web.

Today, your goal is to make the boxes defined in the `div` CSS in `style.css` look like the screenshot in `goal.png`. You'll use `margin` to separate the boxes, and `padding` to change the space betwen the red square and the border.

Good luck!


### Guidelines

* **Don't change the `div` rules**!
* _Do_ make rules for #first, #second, #third, and #fourth.
* Don't freak out about making it pixel-perfect. Not the point here! Don't kill yourself measuring within a few pixels. Close enough is close enough.
